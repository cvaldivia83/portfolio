      <p className="about-paragraph">Hello! My name is Carla and I like creating things that live on the world wide web. </p>

      <p className="about-paragraph">My interest in web development started in 2016 when I began an internship in digital marketing that required hands-on skills to manage a WordPress website. It turns out that editing, creating, and delivering a website taught me a lot about HTML, CSS, and PHP. It also gave me the confidence to realize that coding was something that I was good at. </p>

      <p className="about-paragraph">After four years of working in digital marketing, I decided to take a big step and enrolled in a web development bootcamp where I immersed myself in learning programming languages, frameworks, and software development practices. Upon completion, I was invited to join the staff as a Web Development Lead Teacher. I have since taken on projects and roles that allow me to leverage both my technical skills and my background in digital marketing.</p>

      <p className="about-paragraph">Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>
